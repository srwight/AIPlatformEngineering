# penguin-libs
This repository is for the Penguin gang. It includes the "penguin" library, a collection of useful functions for use in the Yelp project (but perhaps also moving forward).

It is strongly recommended that you put the contents of this repository in a new folder called "penguins", and put that folder in your working folder for the Yelp project.

For example, my Yelp working folder is:

~/Documents/Revature/Group Project/Yelp

so I will store these items 

in ~/Documents/Revature/Group Project/Yelp/penguins
