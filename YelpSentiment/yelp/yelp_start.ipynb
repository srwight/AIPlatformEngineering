under $10 for food with tax.\nWhich sucks cuz this place's best deal, is their \"before 11am, $2.49 breakfast.\"\n\n\nThen again, Sunset Station is close by, and their $7-8 buffet is way better!\nThe food IS goood, just a bit $$$$.  \nWhen we went to pay, I noticed the price was different that the quote from 10 minutes ago by about $40.\nThey paid almost $200 for 2 Buffet of Buffet 24 hour passes .\nWe also got their Caesars Salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap \"free range\" chicken breast that was grilled.  \nTold my close friend to take his $1200 bow purchase elsewhere.\nMeals were in the $18-30 range, including salad and potato.  \nThey have $10 sandwiches, too, but they're not served on Fri/Sat until after 9pm.  \nThey also charge for sharing plates ($2.50) and ask that you split your check prior to ordering.\nAs it turns out, the first line is the \"membership line\" - everyone needs a $5 membership.  \n\n\nCame here for drinks and dinner, the cocktails were 10$ and were pretty small and not very strong but they have good variety.\nPad Thai was flavourless and honestly Thai express does it better :/ the snacks to share are super pricy for what they are, it was 10$ for 3 tiny satay skewers, and another 10$ for 4 tiny pieces of popcorn chicken on a small bed of rice. \n\nTheir hot stone massage was great and you get a full foot and calf massage as part of the $20.\nOkay, so, we had a full meal here, with drinks, for less than $20.\nWe ordered: the Malaysian Curry Chicken with Rice ($6.50), the Malaysian Street Style Sandwich ($5.99), soy milk tea ($1.80) and the hot honey lemon juice ($1.80).\nOur total with tax was around $18.00.\nWith tip, we paid around $21.00.\nSeems a little pricey at about $10 but what isn't pricey in Vegas?\n$14 for the dining experience was well worth it.\nAfter reading the reviews I channeled Liz Lemon and exclaimed, \"$6 vegetarian Indian food?\nI hadn't planned on buying anything, but when I found garam masala for super cheap, and black salt that I had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find, and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks (normally $6-$12 for a tiny jar anywhere else)....well you get the picture.  \nAt the register, I discovered that there was no children's price and that I would be paying more than $30 to enter with my sleeping child.  \nNo child is going to eat $30 worth of buffet food.\nWell, dessert was pretty great, but I don't need to pay almost $100 for my family to eat dessert.  \nEach ticket = $1.25.\n\n\nI paid $57 (without tip) for a full set French manicure with sparkles, and pedicure with design.\nI used to pay $75 for the same service at my last salon. \n\n\nThey are a meal and for $13, they're a very filling meal.\nWe had dinner at BurGR the night before and for the same $100, this is the better option by a long shot. \n\n\nWouldn't it be nice if one day they wold throw in a \" free book of your choice \" with purchase of $5.00 .\nShe took it graciously with a smile and said one of the issues was when they were Fuego Tacos, people ordered $9 plates than proferred a $10 Groupon.  \n(BTW, Fuego del Mar entrees from $20-$25)\n\nMany THANKS to Wild Horse Pass for having a $5min 3 card Poker table on Friday night!  \nI got the chicken fingers and pizza special for $12, which was a great deal.\nWhipped cream from 99 cent store.\nI'm disappointed, especially considering the cupcake was $5 after tax.\nThe bouncers upfront simply took the first equal ratio of guys:girls, leaving me and another guy stuck paying $40 entry.\nDrinks were typical Vegas prices so expect in the neighborhood of $15 per.\n\n\nThe room is probably the best reason to book here if you can get a room during the week for $175 or less.\n$38 for a steak\nTravel weary and need of food -

But considering I have always have superb experiences, it's only fair to give them the credit they deserve. As far as I know, until now, Vegas only had one Freddy's location. I was stoked to find out the new one was opening near me. For me, fast food consists of maybe 5 places- and this is one of them. \nThey serve steak-burgers, so it may cost more than average, but not by much. You can get 2 different styles of burgers: A Freddy's burger that comes with pickle, mustard, and onion. (my preference) Or a California burger. Same meat, but this one comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a \"Freddy's sauce\" which is your typical thousand island, fry sauce, spread, etc. \nThey also offer Chicago style hot dogs, grilled chicken sandwiches, and desserts. \nThe service is always, without a doubt, amazing. They train the employees well and it shows. Good quality, good prices, and good people. \nDo yourself a favor and skip Wendy's, McDonald's, and for sure pass by the Taco Bell next to this place, you won't regret it. \n Stars:  5.0 \n Sentiment:  0.24878787878787884\nThis Gold's is a pretty good gym..for the price. I just have the cheapest membership, which is all I need. When you join they do snake a few charges on you that you don't expect but everybody who gets your credit card does that nowadays don't they? Basic membership probably comes out to around $170 a year and that's not bad at all. \n\nI've been to this Gym around 40 times in the last couple of months. I've never seen any member nor staff clean the equipment so make sure you wipe down before your set. They do have staff clean the facility, empty trash, fix broken equipment which is the way it should be. \n\nThe Gym gets very crowded at times, I think the local football team got a discount to workout there lol. So yeah, on weeknights there's a bunch of high schoolers \"working out\" their smartphones trying to be cool in front of their friends. Still, when it's super crowded I can usually get my workout in, I just have to be flexible and creative. If the place was empty it'd be really boring so there's always a positive spin to everything. \n\nAlmost everybody behaves and they're willing to share equipment. There's no problem with the staff, they are definitely friendly which is a big plus. \n\nOverall, I give this Gym 3 Stars. It's a good gym with a lively atmosphere and you can get your workout in with relative ease. I'd give it a higher rating if they(somebody/anybody) cleaned the equipment and if they didn't sneak all those charges within the first couple of weeks. You just know they'll add some hidden charges at the end too. \n Stars:  3.0 \n Sentiment:  0.14221456994184267\nI'd come here for dinner before and had a great meal but closer to when it first opened. This time, I tried lunch and did not have as wonderful of an experience.\n\n I ordered the antipasto to start and it was served in a bowl almost as a salad on greens. It had about 3 very small pieces of Italian sausage, 2 thin slices of prosciutto, just grilled zucchini as far as grilled vegetables and was mostly greens. This was not at all a good value for the money or what I expect when I order antipasto.\n\nI ordered the gnocchi a la Trio for my entree which was an item with a description that sounded amazing. However, the sauce was way too thin and the whole meal was fairly bland. Which is especially odd since it was supposed to be a gorgonzola cream sauce, which I expected to be very flavourful.\n\nOn another note, the manager/possible owner who was walking around seemed to run the place with an iron fist and simply not be a very nice person. At one point I heard him chew out a chef about how \"When I say something, that's it. There's no discussion.\" Interestingly, he checked in with us mid-meal and was very friendly but his repor with his employees did not put be at ease and I'm less likely to visit a place because of that.\n\nI've rated Trio 3* which is actually pretty generous considering my experience. However, the waiters were very kind and attentive and the dessert was delicious (Tiramisu). That coupled with my original visit mean I'll probably try this place out at least one more time to see if I just caught them on a bad day. \n Stars:  3.0 \n Sentiment:  0.1682777777777778\nNo stars.. yes no stars... (the app made me select one to post) the complete bs I just witnessed as a customer left me with a real stale taste in my mouth. This is the first dine in experience where the stale taste wasn't caused by the food. I went with my family to this location for lunch. The place was busy which is exactly what any good store manager would want; however a good store manager would also want their customers leaving there location feeling respected, valued, & fully satisfied with their dine in experience. Our experience started out great but it slowly showed signs that it was headed down hill when our burgers came to the table before our salads and shakes. We usually frequent the Parmatown location. They seem so much more professional. When our shakes were delivered to the table the chocolate shake made it to the table but the strawberry banana shake was poured into my wifes lap. As you can imagine this feels great in an air conditioned room while wearing shorts. The shake poured straight down my wifes bare leg into her shoe and onto the floor. My wife received a borage of \"I'm sorry!\"s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater. Floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo. They really have no talent or abilities which are beneficial to improving the overall profitability or running of the store. When this location implements points #1,#2, &#3 they will be taking a step in the right direction. It is needless to say that we won't be back anytime soon nor recommending it. \n Stars:  1.0 \n Sentiment:  0.1092743764172336\nI had heard that this place has very good breakfast with quality ingredients and low prices. However, my husband is not a breakfast person so if you go at dinner time breakfast is still available which is something I need to remember. \n\nWe went on a Friday after a long stressful week where we had our wedding coming up a week later  and it provided comfort food for us, typically not what we would normally have but it hit the spot. I had the fried chicken and waffles so a little dinner and breakfast in one and my husband had the smaller chicken fried steak. The portions were large. \n\nThe service was very good and the food came out hot and quick. \n\nThe decor is very cute. It looks like you are in a cozy cabin. \n\nI will def be going back for my comfort food fix! \n Stars:  5.0 \n Sentiment:  0.1257473544973545\nAmazing! We moved to a new house and wanted to protect it. After researching several security companies I spoke with Steve from Smart Security who came out and looked everything over. He is like a consultant for our security needs because he made sure to tell us what was needed, but he also told us what was not needed so we didn't waste our money. This was invaluable. Then our job was more difficult because of the way the home was designed but Steve put in a lot of time, including on the weekend to make sure it was done right (this included cameras and glass break detection, etc). \n\nStop looking around and call them, you will be glad you did. \n Stars:  5.0 \n Sentiment:  0.24421487603305786\nI've been there twice. The first time I got a load of pastries to go (which turned out to be yummy!) and the second time I went for breakfast. Both times, the service was great and the food was great. I don't know what it's called, but there's a filo dough \"tube\" filled w/ spinach and cheeses... get it!  Their signage is practically non-existent, so they're unfortunately easy to miss. It's worth a visit.  :) \n Stars:  4.0 \n Sentiment:  0.45572916666666663\nWe have been searching for a good Chinese restaurant that won't break the bank. We found it! Chin's is amazing! 3 of us went out to eat and all got a different dish and upgraded to the vegetable rice. Add 3 drinks and 6 cream cheese wontons and our bill was $33. The food was spectacular! \n Stars:  5.0 \n Sentiment:  0.44000000000000006\nA co-worker of mine kept talking about Tottie's, so last night I finally gave it a try.  I don't know if it is different dining in, because I ordered take-out, but it was good.  It didn't blow me away, but it was good.  Very similar to good chinese take-out, or maybe a notch up.  I ordered the Tottie Rolls as a starter.  They are crispy egg rolls that you wrap in a lettuce leaf, with mint and parsley.  They come with a sort-of sweet and sour sauce for dipping that was quite nice.  Or atleast I think that is how you are supposed to eat them?  I had a big take out container full of lettuce, mint and parsley, so I figured that was the drill since I didn't order a salad?  They were good.  I ordered the Tangerine Chicken and the Beef Pad Lard Na.  The chicken dish was good, tasted like an orange chicken, deep fried until crispy then tossed in a sweet tangerine sauce.  It had a few strips of red bell pepper also.  The beef dish I liked a little more, it was the wide egg noodles and had chunks of beef, onion, pea pods and bok choy in a really good brown sauce.  You can order many of the dishes mild to HOT, so I did a medium hot since I sharing the dishes I didn't want to blow them out of the water with too spicy of a dish.  Next time I will definitely go hotter!  The dishes came with 2 containers of sticky white rice, which was exactly what it sounds like. I didn't have any dessert, but the crispy bananas sound great, and I am interested in trying the ice creams I keep hearing about.  I also really want to try the soups, they sound good.  \n\nAll in all, it was good (I keep saying good!)  the prices are reasonable, and the portions are big.  I have enough for lunch leftovers today.  So, it is worth giving them a try, and I will be back. \n Stars:  4.0 \n Sentiment:  0.2275173611111111\nPVSEC was amazing when our family dog was attacked by a deer. They took excellent care of our dog and provided constant updates and visits to make us feel as comfortable as possible during a traumatic time. The staff and doctors were wonderful. I was even able to call in the middle of the night and speak to a staff member about how our dog was doing. Everyone clearly loves animals who worked there and made it as easy as possible on our family. They even provided help locating another 24 hour emergency clinic when our dog relapsed a few months later while we were on vacation out of state. Would highly recommend this clinic to care for your furry friend. \n Stars:  5.0 \n Sentiment:  0.28523809523809524\nFood is still excellent! Service is still Meh!

Stands out in a pretty old and gritty neighborhood. Got a bowl with spring rolls with chicken and beef. By the end i was full and just for $10. \n Stars:  3.0 \n Sentiment:  0.1525\nDelicious. Offcourse fruity but its about the experience of a complete flavour. Served with good vibes, Gracias. \n Stars:  5.0 \n Sentiment:  0.6\nWe just recently purchased a house with a pool. Being first time home and pool owners we want to make sure we are doing it correctly. I've taken my water to be tested here multiple times and each time they act as if it's a great inconvenience for them to spend a minute testing the water. \n\nCustomer service seems severely lacking and often feels like they just want you to leave when you walk in. They don't greet you as enter and give half hearted answers to your questions. If you're looking for good service and knowledge please avoid this place. I for one will be looking for a new pool supply store. \n Stars:  1.0 \n Sentiment:  0.27746212121212116\nVery slow and incompetent staff. Food is okay, nothing special.

No matter what time of day I am there everyone is (or pretends to be) in the best mood ever. Very professional, very clean and modern, even relaxing!\n\nEveryone was upfront with pricing, they wanted to make me feel as comfortable as possible (massage options in the chair? tvs above you? headphones for the tv? yes please!), and even though I know they're churning through patients, I never feel rushed out the door if I have questions or concerns. \n\nAfter my initial consultation there I've had my teeth cleaned, old fillings repaired, and even some new cavities filled. They use a three-part numbing process so I've never had issues with pain. \n\nMy only complaint is sometimes, especially towards the end of the year, appointments are hard to book - but that's kind of how it goes most places. \n\nDefinitely recommend them! \n Stars:  5.0 \n Sentiment:  0.21201581027667987\nI was really disappointed with my most recent visit to Vintage 95. I make it out there every six months or so and always talk it up to friends. Tonight I went with my husband and in-laws. We ordered a carafe of sangria, which as always was top notch. My in-laws ordered bruschetta - they ended up with a ton of untoasted bread with a very thin coat of ricotta and a light topping of good quality tomatoes. Tasty but not bruschetta and definitely not worth $14. My husband and I got the \"artisan board\" with one meat and one cheese. For $13, we got a teeny tiny piece of cheese, four thin slices of not-so-good sopressata, stale bread, 2 crackers, raw unsalted almonds, six grapes, and about half a jar of very oniony cornichons! The food was a huge rip-off, and not at all the quality or quantity we have gotten in the past. The saving grace of the night was the sangria, which I still think is one of the best in the area. But overall, I don't think this place is worth a trip out anymore. \n Stars:  2.0 \n Sentiment:  0.051550671550671556\nClean and comfortable. Nice hot breakfast available - eggs, bacon, oatmeal, fruit, pancakes, cinnamon rolls, yogurt, biscuits and gravy. Also has a small (somewhat dated) exercise facility and outdoor pool.\n\nAC made some screeching noises at night that woke me up. Otherwise a nice stay.  \n\nShuttle to airport was handy. \n Stars:  3.0 \n Sentiment:  0.37083333333333335\nI feel like Friday's food menu has gotten worse over the years. The alcohol menu - big improvements, I mean, who wouldn't want a 'Diddy Up' - right?!\n\nThis particular location is hit or miss with the waitstaff - some act like they love their jobs, others look like they hate their lives. Past couple of times I've been there the food came out lukewarm at best. Yesterday, it just so happened that I found a lemon seed in my Brushetta Chicken Pasta, after almost cracking a tooth on it, ew. Although, I will say, I just moved that bad boy to the side and acted like I never saw it. It's probably better that way.\n\nThe seating arrangements are like any other Friday's... booths, tables, a bar. Some of their 'four person' booths would probably be better suited for 2 people or perhaps small children - you won't find any arm room or a place to set your purse here.\n\nSometimes they run dinner specials - an appetizer, entrée, & dessert - somewhere around $11.99 or they've got some 2 for $20 deals.\n\nI'll come back but only because it's cheap-ish & close to home. \n Stars:  2.0 \n Sentiment:  -0.024334733893557427\nHad a groupon so it was a good price.\nVariety of balls available if you dont have your own.\nYou need to use an 8 lb ball if you want bumpers.\nOur lane broke down repeatedly, it even gave up and powered itself off one time. \n Stars:  3.0 \n Sentiment:  0.3861111111111111\nWe ate there yesterday for the first time. My husband ordered fish tacos and I had the five shrimp with sticky rice. He loved his dish. The fish had a nice, slightly spicy sauce on them. It was Mahi Mahi. The shredded veggies were also just perfect. He said he would order it again. I also liked the dish I had. The asparagus was delightful. The rice section was very bland, but our waitress brought some soy sauce for me. This improved everything. I would just ask for soy sauce when ordering this dish again. I would order it again. We also shared a small dessert in a glass. It was boston cream pie. Very tasty. I was happy they had the nice, little desserts. Anything else would have been too much. It was perfect. We will definitely go back. The prices were very reasonable. \n Stars:  4.0 \n Sentiment:  0.3758333333333333\nI have never waited LESS THAN forty five minutes to see my doctor. While the staff are competent and I'm satisfied with the quality of care I've received, the constant over booking definitely soils my opinion.\n\nPeople go to spine specialists because THEY'RE  IN PAIN. Making patients wait for extended periods of time in terribly uncomfortable chairs is painfully ironic.\n\nPLEASE STOP OVER BOOKING.

I always order the Louisiana chicken.....a flattened chicken breast smothered with grilled vegetables and goat cheese. Goat cheese is like bacon...it just makes everything better.\nAlso try their artichoke dip as an appetizer...it is the best out there.\nOn our last visit ( less than a week ago) ,their baked beans were different...hopefully it was just a hiccup because they are usually incredible.\nService is always excellent and the prices are reasonable considering portion size. \n Stars:  4.0 \n Sentiment:  0.4277777777777778\nExcellente place que vous passiez juste prendre un bon thé ou café ou que vous vouliez vous asseoir et manger un brownie décadent ou un grill cheese aux oignons caramélisés.
